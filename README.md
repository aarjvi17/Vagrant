# Vagrant
<<<<<<< HEAD
• First we have install the vagrant our computer.
• All our vagrant instance set up and development are saved in the same folder and inside that folder we have our vagrant file.
• After doing vagrant init, it will generate the Vagrantfile in which we have written all our configuration.
• First we have written the name of the image for the virtual machine, then we have defined the hostname.
• Then we have specify the public network which uses the bridge connection over wifi that includes “dhcp” protocol.
• We have also defined the port forwarding to our file.
• Then for the apache application we have initialized the shell provision which installs the apache in our virtual machine.
• Then using Vagrant up command, it will set up the virtual machine.
• In the Task-2 we have written the shell script to install apache in the virtual machine.
• Using vagrant provisioner we can make a call to our shell script which can directly install apache on our virtual machine.
• In the Task-3 we have made the Multimachine topology using the Vagrantfile.
• Which installs the centos and ubuntu virtual machine together using a single Vagrantfile.
• We have defined instance image, hostname, network etc in the file.
